# Classifying Tweets as Football or Soccer using Natural Language Processing and Random Forests


This project is focused on the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) and using
random forests as a classification model for text analysis. More specifically, our project involves
preprocessing large, text datasets and representing this data as a feature matrix using a
bag-of-words model. Then, using this feature matrix to create a decision tree classifier and later,
a random forest. After finishing this exercise, you will have a clear understanding of the
importance of preprocessing text and the methods used to do so. Furthermore, you will be able
to understand the what a decision tree is and how it extracts the most important features from a
dataset. Lastly, youâ€™ll learn about the overfitting in decision trees, and see how Random Forests
overcome overfitting simply by averaging the results of an ensemble of decision trees. We used
the concepts explained in this final project and implemented a text analysis program which
classifies whether a tweet is talking about the National Football League (NFL) or the English
Premier League (EPL) or broadly speaking: American football or soccer. Using our own dataset
of tweets scraped from twitter, we implemented a binary classifier using random forests with an
error rate < 4%.
